THE PROBLEM & NEED FOR A SOLUTION
	This marketplace application is aimed at solving a personal problem. When I moved overseas, I tried to be efficient and brought a number of appliances with me. I planned to use a converter, however, said converter was over advertised and under powered. After one fried immersion blender, I opted to abandon the hopes of using any other American appliances. Instead I kept dreaming I could easily connect with individuals moving to the USA so they could take my appliances with them and I could have theirs that worked in Australia. With such a global population, there must be other individuals in the same boat, but the problem is how to connect with them. At present, one could post or peruse gumtree, craigslist, or other community bulletins. But wouldn’t it be great if there was a go to app?

FEATURES & FUNCTIONALITY
	This two way marketplace will connect buyers and sellers in the expat community. Each user with have a profile that they can log into with their email and password. From there they will have the option to post an item for sale, view their items, or browse to buy. At checkout payment details will be taken using Stripe.

Growth
	This could be extended to have regional marketplaces to cut down on shipping (isn’t that the whole purpose anyway?!). I would also like to add a swap feature if two individuals agree that their appliances are equal in worth. With more time, I would include geocoding and mapping of sellers.

TARGET AUDIENCES
	I am specifically targeting those who have moved overseas or those planning to move overseas. The individuals are going to be adults with household goods. Having just moved, or with a pending move on the horizon, these individuals may be stressed and tired. For this reason I have chosen an orange user interface for inspiring confidence.


USER STORIES
https://trello.com/b/GWwIQGbP/marketplace-app
	There will be buyers, sellers, and an admin for the site. Buyers will be interested in browsing, searching, using a checkout cart, and purchasing products posted on the site. Sellers will want to post an item or many with the options of editing and deleting listings. Both buyers and sellers may want to contact the admin with enquiries and feedback.
